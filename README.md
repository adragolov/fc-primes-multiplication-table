# Prime Numbers Multiplication Table

This repository serves the result for a coding challenge with the following definition: 


* A *Ruby* program that prints out a multiplication table of the first 10 prime numbers. 
* The program runs from the command line and prints to screen a single table. 
* Across the top header and down the left lead of the table are the 10 primes, and the body of the table contains the product of multiplying these numbers.
